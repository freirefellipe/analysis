#### When selecting columns, it's useful to write each one of htem in a different line in order to make the visualization easier.

SELECT column1,
column2,
column3 + 10 (visualization easier)
FROM database.table


#### Order operation in mysql is PEMDAS:
# Parenthesis
# Exponential
# Multiplication
# Division
# Addition
# Subtraction

# The DISTINCT command will rule out repeated datum. If two columns were chosen, the criterium for distinction would be the conjuntion of both columns.

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2
